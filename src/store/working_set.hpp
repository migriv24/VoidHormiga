/* store/working_set.hpp — what Void Core holds of a database, and keeping the
 * store in step with it (okf/concepts/platform/store.md).
 *
 * `load` gives Core a state document the store writes for a Selection: the
 * mantles chosen whole, the clusters chosen of the rest, and edges whose both
 * ends are loaded. Every edit is still a dispatcher command on that Core
 * (CLAUDE.md rule 3). `sync`, called after commands land, makes the store say
 * what Core now says:
 *
 *  - what Core holds is compared with what it held at the last sync, rune by
 *    rune and edge by edge, and only the difference is written;
 *  - a rune is followed by its spirit id, so a rename is a rename (every edge
 *    that names it changes too, loaded or not) and an undo of a removal brings
 *    back what the removal took, including edges to runes never loaded;
 *  - runes Core never held are never touched.
 *
 * The cost of a sync is proportional to the working set, never to the
 * database. A NEW rune may not take the name of a rune that is not loaded:
 * Core cannot see it, so `name_taken` is what a caller minting names asks, and
 * `sync` refuses such a write rather than overwrite a rune nobody looked at. */
