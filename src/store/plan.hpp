/* store/plan.hpp — what a working set holds, on this machine
 * (okf/concepts/platform/store.md).
 *
 * THE BUDGET is a share of the machine's physical memory: an eighth, between
 * 128 MB and 4 GB, so a 2 GB device gives the working set 256 MB. Everything a
 * working set costs counts against it. Measured on the 5×10^5-rune stress
 * database (tests/store_bench.cpp), per byte of state text:
 *   Void Core's tree ×6.1 · the projected scene ×5.8 · each undo frame ×5.5
 *   · the exported text ×1 · a `save`'s baseline ×5.5 · transient parses ×6
 * so a working set costs about (25 + 5.5 × undo depth) times its text. The
 * undo depth is part of the budget: 4 on a small machine, 16 on a large one.
 *
 * THE PLAN: a database that fits is loaded whole, and is exactly what it was
 * before the store. One that does not keeps its small mantles whole
 * (documents, settings, the Antfarm) and loads the large ones by cluster: the
 * leaf the person is looking at, then its neighbours in the hierarchy (leaves
 * of one parent sort together) while they fit. A large mantle with no
 * clustering yet loads its first runes, in order. */
